* ConnectIQ App: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/de11adc4-fdbb-40b5-86ac-7f93b47ea5bb
* Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.surfsite.gexporter


## HOWTO
* start the Android app https://github.com/gimportexportdevs/gexporter on your mobile device (where your Garmin Connect app runs)
* build and start this Connect IQ app
* press "Start/Enter" to download the first (as of now) file
* check that the FIT file was imported (e.g. check the courses folder or start an activitiy with the course)

## TODO
* add UI to select one of the tracks for download (currently only the first one works)
* better error handling
* start the downloaded course
* let the user configure the initial URL/server/port
